Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 

- Open and immediately close, because there's no line stopping it from doing so.

Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 

- It ended the code. 

What do you think the program did with what you typed?

- Nothing, because the code had no reason to do anything with it.

Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 

- Same thing as the last code, except it will also show the color I answer before ending.

What do you think the color = input() will do? 

- Save what was answered as text within the file.

Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?

- Yup

Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

- This code is expecting me to say red, and when I won't say red, it's supposed to tell me I'm wrong.

What is happening on lines 11–14? 

- The program is reading the input given and matching it to the word 'Red'.  If the input doesn't match, it will display the alternate text.

Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 

- They are a part of the function above them.

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 

- It displays 'Sorry, try again.'

What does this tell you about "color"?

- 'color' is now being used with in the code.

Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

- The code is accounting for the case sensitivity

What problem is this trying to solve? 

- Case sensitivity

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?

- It doesn't work.

Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

- Properly fix the case sensitivity issue by processing the input as lowercase, ignoring what the case used.

What problem is it trying to solve? 

- Case sensitivity

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?

- It doesn't work.

Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

- The input is now being processed with the '.strip()' function.

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

- It's removing any characters that are 'blank', like spaces.

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?

- Using puncuation.

Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

- Entering in 'pink' will show different text.

What is the purpose of line 11? 

- It sets the input to lowercase and no spaces.

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

- It sets a loop, so the user can keep entering answers.

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

- They are part of the while loop.

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

What is the purpose of “count”? 

What is happening on line 22? 

Run the program.
